    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**:\n",
    "<p>To elaborate on our architecture, it consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes input images using a pre-trained ResNet model to extract meaningful features. These features are then encoded into a fixed-size vector, which serves as input to the decoder. The decoder, in turn, generates captions for the input images based on the extracted features.</p>\n",
    "Regarding the selection of variable values:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li><p>Batch size (128): After experimentation, I settled on a batch size of 128. This size balances weight adjustment effectiveness during training, ensuring a moderate learning pace without sacrificing convergence efficiency.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p>Vocabulary threshold (8): The vocabulary threshold is set to filter out non-essential words for describing images. A threshold less than 10 was deemed rational, considering its impact on the model's generalization ability.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p>Vocabulary from file (False): By specifying it as False, a new vocabulary dictionary is created based on the sample size. This to ensures adaptability to different dataset sizes.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p>Embed size (256): The embed size, set to 256, determines the array size to which tokenized words are mapped during training. This size, obtained from the dataset post-vocabulary threshold application, aids in predicting the next suitable word based on the current word.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p>Hidden size (512): The hidden size in LSTM networks, set to 512, dictates the dimensionality of the hidden state vector. This parameter is pivotal in capturing temporal and long-range dependencies in sequential data. Through experimentation, a value of 512 struck a balance between capturing complex patterns and avoiding overfitting or underfitting.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p>Number of epochs (2): Despite trying up to 5 epochs, the model ceased to improve significantly after the first epoch. Therefore, the number of epochs was set to 2 to allow the model to traverse the dataset twice. Adaptable learning rate scheduling could potentially enhance learning beyond the initial epoch</p></li>\n",

    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I added two functions and kept the remaining functions in transform_train as they were. This is because transform_train effectively employs augmentation techniques such as normalization and resizing all images to a uniform size. Additionally, it performs random cropping, which helps the model learn robust features and prevents overfitting. The ResNet model is pre-trained effectively, and the images processed through it produce features that are passed to our decoder. I incorporated random horizontal flipping and random rotation, which further assist the decoder model in understanding the extracted features from multiple perspectives and help to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Since the ResNet model is already effectively pre-trained, I selected the parameters of the embedding layer in the encoder (list(encoder.embed.parameters())) and all parameters of the decoder model (list(decoder.parameters())) to be trainable. This choice allows the embedding layer in the encoder to capture the knowledge extracted from the ResNet model and enables the decoder to learn from these fine-tuned features. This approach helps the model adapt to the specific dataset and capture new features during training, enhancing its ability to generate accurate and relevant captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I selected the Adam optimizer with the following configuration: torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=learning_rate, weight_decay=weight_decay). I set the learning rate to 0.001 to ensure it is neither too large, which might cause the optimizer to skip capturing important features, nor too small, which would make the learning process excessively slow. Additionally, I chose a weight decay of 0.0001 as a regularization technique to help avoid overfitting."

    "It is completely fine to leave the code cell below as-is without modifications to train your model.  However, if you would like to modify the code used to train the model below, you must ensure that your changes are easily parsed by your reviewer.  In other words, make sure to provide appropriate comments to describe how your code works!  \n",

    "You may find it useful to load saved weights to resume training.  In that case, note the names of the files containing the encoder and decoder weights that you'd like to load (`encoder_file` and `decoder_file`).  Then you can load the weights by using the lines below:\n",

    "### A Note on Tuning Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out how well your model is doing, you can look at how the training loss and perplexity evolve during training - and for the purposes of this project, you are encouraged to amend the hyperparameters based on this information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will not tell you if your model is overfitting to the training data, and, unfortunately, overfitting is a problem that is commonly encountered when training image captioning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you need not worry about overfitting. **This project does not have strict requirements regarding the performance of your model**, and you just need to demonstrate that your model has learned **_something_** when you generate captions on the test data.  For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
